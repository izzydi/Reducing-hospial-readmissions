# Reducing-hospital-readmissions-with-Machine-Learning


## Background
You work for a consulting company helping a hospital group better understand patient readmissions. The hospital gave you access to ten years of information on patients readmitted to the hospital after being discharged. The doctors want you to assess if initial diagnoses, number of procedures, or other variables could help them understand the probability of readmission. They want to focus follow-up calls and attention on those patients with a higher probability of readmission.


## Create a report that covers the following:

1. What is the most common primary diagnosis by age group?
2. Some doctors believe diabetes might play a central role in readmission. Explore the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on readmission rates.
3. On what groups of patients should the hospital focus their follow-up efforts to better monitor patients with a high probability of readmission?


## Information in the Dataset

1. "age" - age bracket of the patient
2. "time_in_hospital" - days (from 1 to 14)
3. "n_procedures" - number of procedures performed during the hospital stay
4. "n_lab_procedures" - number of laboratory procedures performed during the hospital stay
5. "n_medications" - number of medications administered during the hospital stay
6. "n_outpatient" - number of outpatient visits in the year before a hospital stay
7. "n_inpatient" - number of inpatient visits in the year before the hospital stay
8. "n_emergency" - number of visits to the emergency room in the year before the hospital stay
9. "medical_specialty" - the specialty of the admitting physician
10. "diag_1" - primary diagnosis (Circulatory, Respiratory, Digestive, etc.)
11. "diag_2" - secondary diagnosis
12. "diag_3" - additional secondary diagnosis
13.  "glucose_test" - whether the glucose serum came out as high (> 200), normal, or not performed
14. "A1Ctest" - whether the A1C level of the patient came out as high (> 7%), normal, or not performed
15. "change" - whether there was a change in the diabetes medication ('yes' or 'no')
16. "diabetes_med" - whether a diabetes medication was prescribed ('yes' or 'no')
17. "readmitted" - if the patient was readmitted at the hospital ('yes' or 'no')
